# Linking
For this assignment, you are to write two small programs - one in C and one in C++ - and examine each of the steps in the process that converts the source code into an executable binary. Each program will consist of multiple files and each will include a variety of variables of different types and scopes, ( e.g. global/local, static/auto, basic/pointers/references/user-defined ), so that we can see how each of these are stored in each of the transition steps. Finally you are to answer some questions regarding your results, to demonstrate your ability to use the relevant tools. Note: For Fall 2014, the C++ portion of this assignment is an optional enhancement.
